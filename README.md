## Introduction

p5.js is a JavaScript library designed to make coding visualizations and interactive graphics easy and accessible. By leveraging p5.js, these projects aim to blend art and technology, creating engaging and innovative visual experiences. 

## Getting Started

To explore or run these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Careless-Loser/IfrahImtiaz-CreativeCoding
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd IfrahImtiaz-CreativeCoding
   ```

3. **Open the Project**

   Each project is contained in its own subdirectory. Navigate to a specific project directory and open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the sketch.

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

   You can also use a local server to view the projects. For example, using `live-server`:

   ```bash
   npx live-server
   ```

4. **Dependencies**

   The projects rely on the p5.js library. Ensure you have an internet connection to load p5.js from a CDN or download it to include locally.
